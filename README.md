nlp tensorflow course 3 coursera

week1- Loading data from file gives labels and data then we tranform it to numbers using Tokenization and padding 

week2- we then give words a meaning using word embeddings.(image pixels already have menaing in terms of pixl intensities). We can learn them using an embedding layer or use a pretrained model.

week3- we used LSTM and RNN, GRU, Conv layers, multiple stacked lstm as sequence models for using **context of data/sentences**.

week3_exercise- preventing overfitting using larger dataset & pretrained word embeddings.

week4- we use NLP techniques to generate text/poetry, text generation.
